Jarvis is a simple personal assistant which works on the command line. He can talk to you if you enable his voice. He can tell you the weather, he can send email to someone , search for stuff on google chrome and wikipedia and control ur loggin in, shutting down of your device. He can do some great stuff for you.


In order to run on this on ur device you need to install the following thing on terminal with pip command:
1. pyttsx3
2. speechRecognition
